It’s something I think about often because TKTKTKTKT.\r

In the past few generations, work in America has become far [less physical](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2006/03/art3full.pdf). A lot of farming and factory work was replaced by jobs that can be done from a desk. And, in turn, work became far less backbreaking—and far safer.\r

But our society still needs lots of people to do physical, grueling, and dirty jobs. To understand what Sitters and Standers look like in today’s economy, I looked at the [Occupational Requirements Survey](https://www.bls.gov/ors/), a federal program that surveys workers at more than 55,000 workplaces. The survey asks workers what the physical requirements of their jobs are—including sitting and standing*.\r

Meanwhile, one of the primary concerns for Sitters is that it promotes a sedentary lifestyle, which leads to health problems. Office designers have spent lots of time [trying to increase](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35014589/) the amount of time Sitters are active throughout the day. Meanwhile, standing desks are only getting [more and more popular](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/standing-desks-market-report).\r

After a few years, they sold the dry cleaning business and eventually got into the vending machine business. My dad pushed around vending machines and boxes full of food, while my mom packed muffins and sandwiches. That was also grueling work.\r

One day, I remember my dad was late coming home from work. I was worried sick.\r
\r
\r
Finally, he called to check in: His hand was stuck in a vending machine gear, and the fire department was on the way to help him get out. \r

My dad ended up being OK. In fact, a year after that incident, he was able to go back to school to continue his education. I’m so thankful he had that choice.`},{cat:"The power of choice",stage:"all_jobs",addclass:"longform",text:`I’m a Sitter, and I’ve been a Sitter my entire life.
