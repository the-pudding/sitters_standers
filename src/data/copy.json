A lot of farming and factory work was replaced by jobs that can be done from a desk. And, in turn, work became far less backbreaking—and far safer.\r\n\r\n\r\n>> Fatalities | 1970, 2022\r\n>> Injuries | Link (Page 40)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut our society still needs lots of people to do physical, grueling, and dirty jobs. To understand what Sitters and Standers look like in today’s economy, I looked at the [Occupational Requirements Survey](https://www.bls.gov/ors/), a federal program that surveys workers at more than 55,000 workplaces. The survey asks workers what the physical requirements of their jobs are—including sitting and standing*.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"note\">* While the large majority of occupations have available data on sitting standing, some don’t.
